So, will you help tie this to perhaps the overall usage growth at AWS?

I think historically on the e-commerce side, you have been price followers as opposed to price leaders. AWS, you have been price leaders for the most part for actively taking down price. Now, given your leadership position, do you think you\\'ll continue to be price leaders? Or, do you think it\\'s now time for you to follow instead? Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [43]\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n          Let me start with your CapEx question. We like to look at both capital expenditures and capital leases because they\\'re both essentially our level of investment. Those totaled $9.5 billion in the trailing 12 months, and it was up 7% from the 12-month period ending this quarter last year. I will point out that the prior year was $6.1 billion. We have stepped up investment. Although it did not go up as much year-over-year this quarter, we are still spending almost $10 billion on what essentially is fulfillment capacity in support of really strong growth -- unit growth in FBA and global expansion and then also on AWS. Additional capacity for existing customers as they grow their business and also in new regions. We\\'ve been working and continue to work very hard on capital productivity. It\\'s very important to us and I attribute a good piece of the ability to keep that at a modest growth rate year-over-year to our capital efficiency and better purchasing across all capital and capital leases quite frankly. But, again, we are spending almost $10 billion.\", \"Thanks, Phil. I\\'ll begin with comments on our first-quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $6.4 billion, up from $3.2 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principal repayments increased to $3.5 billion up from $1.5 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow less financed lease principal repayments and assets required under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion.\\\\nTrailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.9 billion. Capital expenditures do not include the impact of property and equipment acquired under capital and finance and lease obligations. These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.\\\\nThe combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 490 million shares compared with 483 million one year ago. Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion, or 29% excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Worldwide active customer accounts, excluding customers who only had pre-orders in the preceding 12-month period, exceeded 285 million. Worldwide paid unit growth was 27%. Worldwide seller units represented 48% of paid units.\\\\nNow, I\\'ll talk about our segment results. In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results. These amounts are combined and titled stock-based compensation and other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations. For reference this quarter, I\\'ll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other.\", \"In the North America segment, revenue grew 27% to $17 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to $3.2 billion. EGM revenue grew 32% to $13.5 billion. North America segment operating income including stock-based compensation and other was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year. This includes $5 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. North America\\'s segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year.\\\\nIn the international segment, revenue grew 24% to $9.6 billion. Excluding the $177 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 26%. Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion, or 9% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue grew 31% to $7 billion, or 33% excluding foreign exchange. International segment operating loss including stock-based compensation and other was $121 million compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year. This includes $21 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year.\\\\nIn the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 64% to $2.6 billion. Amazon Web Services segment operating income including stock-based compensation and other was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year. This includes $24 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange. Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year.\", \"Thank you. I have two. I think it\\'s the first time 1Q 2011 that we see tech and content counted as a percentage of revenue declining or flat. Is it just a sign of your inability to increase investment in line with revenue growth? Or, is there something going on, if yes, what?\\\\nSecondly, Brian, you said that the growth of Prime has been driven by investments you have made or are making. You gave the examples of devices that you are selling. I think it\\'s a mathematical certainty that Prime subscribers would accelerate in North America at some point from 50% growth. As penetration increases and growth slows, will we see a deceleration in the investment levels? In other words, how do we think about the effect of deceleration in Prime on the North American margin structure in the future? Thank you.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nBrian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [22]\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n          Sure. Let me start with that second one. We think there\\'s a lot of room to grow not only in our international countries but also in the US. We plan on continuing to build the benefits of the Prime program from music to video to two-day shipping to same-day shipping to Prime Now. I don\\'t see that dissipating, and it remains the best deal in retail so hopefully everyone signs up for that.\\\\nOn the tech and content question, I don\\'t have a lot to call out in the quarter. I would say there\\'s no letup in the pace of invention here particularly on the AWS side. We used quote the number of new features and services to you each quarter. We had 214 in Q1 up from the 170 this first quarter of last year. Over 26% growth in this quarter alone coming off a year where I believe the number was 722 significant new features and services delivered for AWS customers last year.\", \"Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask you about unit growth overall and if we look back over the last three quarters, you\\'ve accelerated it now to a materially higher level than what we saw in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and I realize in 3Q last year you had Prime Day. I was hoping you could comment on the overall acceleration we\\'ve seen here and key drivers behind that? And, if there\\'s something different perhaps than what you talked about on international?\\\\nAlso, on AWS, can you talk about the underlying drivers here of margins and thinking about that a little bit going forward primary sources of leverage? As you open up six new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be constant build-out? Or, something that\\'s more lumpy over time and more in waves? Thanks.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nPhil Hardin,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [6]\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n          This is Phil Hardin. I\\'ll take the units question. Really the units are driven by very similar trends to what Brian described. When we look at the bridges for revenue, and obviously, units is our key driver of revenue. Things like Prime are key in that bridge. I would also call out selection growth. That has been a big area of focus for us.\\\\nOne important way we drive selection is through FBA. We continue to be very pleased with the progress we\\'re making in FBA. What that means for our Prime customers is there\\'s more for them to choose from. Obviously, that gives them more they can purchase. It makes Prime more valuable. For sellers, it means they sell more. I would say that FBA is helping drive some of the selection growth we\\'re seeing here. Selection growth and Prime though are two very key drivers of our growth.
